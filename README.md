In this project you will implement a clustering algorithm that is based on symmetric Non-negative
Matrix Factorization (symNMF). You will further apply it to several datasets and compare to Kmeans. This document starts by introducing the mathematical basis and algorithms for the
project, and then describes the code and implementation requirements.
